ðŸ’™
I am a programmer and software developer. I love programming and solving complex problems,
and I program in multiple languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java. On GitHub I share open source projects and useful tools.
I also like to share my experiences and knowledge with others so that we can benefit from joint learning.

ðŸ”§ Currently I am looking for opportunities to collaborate on new projects as well as learn and improve my skills.
If you are interested in cooperation or consulting in similar fields,
contact me. I am always open to collaboration and networking.
